Dear Christian and Jerome,
Thanks for establishing iso lisp mail address through cs-net.
As I sent my telefax and e-mail(hoping that either of them has been received by
you) I have found that I will be busy at the end of next June since I will be
the chairman of our Department.After the middle of next September to the end
of next November I will be not busy,compared with other days.
So I would like to propose the exchange of Toyo(or Sendai) meeting and Munich
meeting as follows
  the 6th WG,at Munich, the end of next June or the beginning(or sometime) of
             next July(I may not be able to attend,but Dr. Yuasa will attend.)
  the 7th WG,at Tokyo or Sendai, September 20,21 and 22,1989
             (I will take care of having this meeting.)
I hope that this will work.
Looking forward to seeing you at Brussels.
Sincerely,
Takayasu Ito

At the 2nd ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG16 at Snowbird we made two votes on designing
ISO Lisp. Most of the members expressed their intersts on designing Long Term
Design of ISO Lisp,after or simanltanously of ISLIP.
Then, what is ISO Lisp in Long Term Design?
I would like to propose to exchange some opinions on this matter,at the 3rd WG16meeting at Brussels.
Looking forward to seeing you at Brussels.

Subject:  US Position Statement

Received:  by challenger id AA02698g; Thu, 10 Nov 88 09:23:43 PST


The following is the US Position Statement, which was requested at the
Snowbird ISO meeting. This position statement was developed by X3J13
with the collaboration of Chris Haynes and Will Clinger from the IEEE
Scheme standardization group. This statement accurately represents the
position of X3J13.

*********************************************************************

The US is currently undertaking two standardization efforts in Lisp:
X3J13 is standardizing Common Lisp for ANSI, and IEEE is standardizing
Scheme.  The US believes that these two efforts cover a wide range of
concerns and uses for Lisp: Scheme is small, elegant, and
mathematically well-founded, and Common Lisp is full-featured, mature,
and commercially viable.  Within the United States, there is no demand
for another Lisp standard at this time. 

The current activity of WG16 is to develop a standard for a dialect of
Lisp directed at a community of users who are served neither by Common
Lisp nor by Scheme---that dialect is IsLisp.  Although is is unlikely
that IsLisp will have major near term commercial significance within
the US, the US supports the IsLisp standardization effort as long as
it does not negatively affect standards for other dialects of Lisp.
In particular, the US feels that it is important not to have two
standardized dialects of Lisp that are nearly identical unless one is
a strict subset of the other.  Having two such similar but different
dialects weakens the position of users who have come to depend on one
of the dialects.

The US believes that the primary focus of standardization is to codify
existing practice to support the creation and delivery of portable
software.  Thus, the major focus of the US standardization efforts is
to provide stability to the community of Common Lisp and Scheme users.
Of secondary importance are the invention of new Lisp dialects and the
standardization of Lisp dialects or features not in common usage.  The
US therefore agrees with the ISO goal of a near term standard in the
1990 time frame along with longer range consideration of future
dialects and features.

Common Lisp is in wide use in Europe, Japan, and Australia.
Implementations of Common Lisp are under way in the UK, Germany,
Italy, and Japan (and possibly other countries).  In each of these
countries there are companies whose customers depend on portable
software written in Common Lisp.  The future of these companies thus
depends on having a Common Lisp standard.

The US believes that Common Lisp is a valid candidate for
international standardization both because it is used internationally
and also because it is a mature and stable dialect.  Common Lisp has
been under design and specification for 8 years.  Commercial quality
implementations of Common Lisp have been available for 4 years.  The
near term standardization of ISO Common Lisp would have substantial
positive impact on the acceptance of existing commercial Lisp
implementations and on the viability of future Lisp dialects as
vehicles for emerging applications.

For these reasons, the US proposes the development of an ISO standard
for Common Lisp.  Furthermore, the US proposes that WG16 request X3J13
to prepare the ISO draft standard for Common Lisp.  The ISO Common
Lisp draft and the ANSI Common Lisp draft should be identical.  The US
believes such a draft standard could be developed by December 1989.
The US also believes the development of an ISO standard for Common
Lisp is within the charter of WG16, which endorses the standardization
of multiple dialects of Lisp. At some point in the future, it may be
appropriate to develop an ISO standard for Scheme.

Looking beyond near term standardization, the US feels that an
important task for WG16 is working towards a next generation dialect
of Lisp, and this can be accomplished by drawing on the lessons
learned from existing dialects of Lisp.

At the autumn meeting of X3J13 I presented the two questions posed at
the September WG 16 meeting in Sendai Japan. The first question was
asked as follows:

   Each member body willing to participate to the ``CL subset approach''
   is requested to produce for the next WG 16 meeting:

   -Its definition of ``kernel'' concept

   -The list of features that must be present in the Kernel

The following is the precise answer formulated by X3J13:

   Several times X3J13 considered the question of Common Lisp subsets.
   There was a subcommittee on subsets which was unable to produce an
   acceptable subset definition; the iteration subcommittee considered
   making some iteration constructs optional and decided against it; and
   the optionality of CLOS was considered and rejected because there has
   been a recognized need for object-oriented programming in Lisp.

   X3J13 finally decided that no technically acceptable subset is
   consistent with the primary goals of X3J13, which place a strong
   emphasis on portability of code.

   Therefore, X3J13 advises against ISO WG 16 standardizing a subset of
   Common Lisp.

The second question was asked as follows:

   Each member body is requested to identify their long term goals and
   starting preferences.

The following is the precise answer formulated by X3J13:

   X3J13 is interested in exploring long-term Lisp standardization by
   focusing on areas such as parallel processing, modules, distributed
   computing, multi-language programming, and user interfaces.  At this
   time, X3J13 has no more detailed ideas about a starting point for long
   term standardization.

X3J13 also prepared the following statement, which they asked me to
distribute to WG 16:

   X3J13 was not explicitly requested to do so, but we would like to
   clarify our intention in the following sentence from page 1-17:

      The language described in this standard contains no subsets,
      although subsets are not forbidden.

   We mean by this that we do not support subset standards, but we do support
   (and envision) subset implementations.  Such implementations would be marked
   as specified in Section 1.5, bullet 6.

   To clarify what we mean when we use the word subset:

      Language L is a subset of language L' iff
       for every valid program P in language L
        P is also a valid program in language L'
         and P has the same defined behavior in both L and L'.

I understand L&FP registration is Tuesday, 26th June.  This
should not be a conflict with a WG16 meeting in Sophia since
it is presumably a short train/car ride back to Nice that evening.

What is the agenda?  For example, what documents
are expected to be commented upon?  Even a pre-preliminary agenda sent
